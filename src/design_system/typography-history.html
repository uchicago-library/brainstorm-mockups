          <span class="element-label badge">h2</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>The history of the book stretches back thousands of years, long before the invention of paper or the printing press. In ancient <mark>Mesopotamia and Egypt</mark>, people developed early writing systems and methods for recording information that would define their civilizations.</p>

        <div class="element-with-label mb-3">
          <p class="text-muted">The earliest "books" were not bound pages, but rather clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform scripts. The Sumerians around 3200 BCE created these durable records, which served as <strong>the first permanent storage of knowledge</strong>. These tablets documented everything from <em>business transactions to epic poetry</em>.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of Papyrus</h3>
        
        <div class="element-with-label mb-3">
          <p>By 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians discovered papyrus, a lightweight material made from the papyrus plant. This innovation represented a <s>temporary setback for clay tablets</s> breakthrough in convenience and portability. Papyrus scrolls became the standard for recording sacred texts, historical records, and literary works throughout the Egyptian world.</p>
          <span class="element-label badge">p</span>

        <p>Key characteristics of papyrus documents included:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and portable compared to clay tablets</li>

            <li>Vulnerable to moisture and decay</li>

        <h3>The Codex Revolution</h3>
        
        <div class="element-with-label mb-3">
          <p>The Romans adapted an earlier concept into what we recognize today as a book: pages bound together on one side. This <u>revolutionary format</u> offered numerous advantages over scrolls, including easier navigation, better preservation, and the ability to write on both sides of the page. Religious communities, particularly monasteries, became the custodians of knowledge during the Middle Ages.</p>
          <span class="element-label badge">p</span>

        <p>Medieval manuscripts were characterized by:</p>
        <div class="element-with-label mb-3">
          <ol>
            <li>Hand illumination and artistic decoration</li>

            <li>Use of parchment (animal skin) instead of papyrus</li>
            <li>Binding in leather and precious materials</li>
            <li>Extreme scarcity—a single book could take months to copy</li>

        <p>In 1440, <strong>Johannes Gutenberg</strong> invented the movable type printing press, an innovation that fundamentally transformed the world. This technology made books affordable, accessible, and reproducible on an unprecedented scale.</p>

        <p>The first major work printed using movable type was <em>the Gutenberg Bible</em>, produced around 1455.

        <p>The first printed books, or <strong>incunabula</strong>, were produced between 1450-1500. A remarkable table showing the growth of printing during this period:</p>

        <p>From the 16th century onward, book production became an established industry. Printing presses spread throughout Europe, creating an information economy that would last for 500 years.</p>

        <h3>Evolution of Publishing</h3>
        
        <p>The business of books evolved considerably. What began as a craft of monks and monks evolved into a sophisticated industry with publishers, editors, and booksellers. Consider these developments:</p>

        <div class="element-with-label mb-3">
          <ul>
          <li>Standardized book sizes and formats
            <ul>
              <li>Folio—large format for important texts</li>
              <li>Quarto—medium, practical size</li>
              <li>Octavo—smaller, more portable</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Copyright and intellectual property laws emerged</li>
          <li>Public libraries began collecting and distributing books</li>
          <li>Mass market paperbacks made reading even more affordable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the 19th century, steam-powered printing presses accelerated production further. By the 20th century, <a href="#" class="link-info">digital technologies began to challenge traditional book publishing</a>, though printed books remain central to culture and learning.</p>
