## **🚨 Critical Reminders**
- **This is a static site.** No backend, no database.
- **GitHub Pages is the host.** Optimize for performance and simplicity.
- **Reusability is key.** Developers should copy/paste HTML/SCSS directly into other projects.

## **📌 Instructions**
### **1. General Rules**
- Always start with the provided `README.md`.
- Never modify files inside `/docs/` and most work will happen in `/src/`.
- Do not add code examples.
- Maintain a navigation of `/design_system/` and `/design_mockups/` and `/methodology/` in `src/index.html` with appropriate nesting.
- HTML page files (not components) are documental and don't need extra styling to be engaging. Focus on clean, semantic markup and basic Bootstrap styling. Do not apply heading classes (e.g., `h1`, `h2`).
- Always use existing variables, classes and components where possible. Avoid creating new ones unless necessary.
- Ask for clarifications if any instruction is unclear, conflicting, or appears to be a bad idea.
- This is a self-documented design system website that uses it's own design system. Keep in mind `src/methodology` when writing content.
